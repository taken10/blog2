Comcast first announced machineQ service in October 2016 with trials in Philadelphia and San Francisco Bay Area,
expanding to Chicago in November. Now it's rolling the service out in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Denver, Detroit,
Indianapolis, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Oakland, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Washington, D.C.
　　
We believe that Comcast has a unique opportunity to leverage our existing network assets and Semtech's LoRa technology,
to fuel IoT innovation with disruptive new business models and smarter cities,
said Alex Khorram, general manager of machineQ, in a release.

We've seen excitement about a Comcast solution that is opening a whole new world of use cases that were previously
not commercially viable due to the cost of connectivity and end devices, limited battery life and inability to get coverage.
